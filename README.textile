h1. resume-http-beam

A Node.js web app to beam my résumé to the grateful masses via HyperText Transfer Protocol. Energize!

This is currently running on a previously idling AWS EC2 instance here: "jdahlq.com":http://jdahlq.com

h3. Setup
# Install Node.js v0.8.9. (It will probably work on much older versions, though.)
# Clone the repo.
# While inside your repo directory, do an @npm install@ to install the dependencies.
# Start the server with @node server@ and voila! If you want to use a different port, then: @node server --port 1337@

Notes:
* None of these resources take parameters.
* The return values are a mixture of objects, arrays, and strings.
* I live in the Fremont neighborhood of Seattle, so the hammer and sickles are obligatory.
